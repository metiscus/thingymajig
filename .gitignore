# Local SQLite Database file
# This database file is stored in your user's application data directory,
# e.g., C:\Users\YourUser\AppData\Roaming\rom-planner-app\database\rom_planner.db on Windows
# or ~/Library/Application Support/rom-planner-app/database/rom_planner.db on macOS.
# You generally do NOT want to commit user data to your source control.
# If you run the app and it creates a local file directly in your project root for dev purposes,
# you would ignore it like:
# rom_planner.db
# However, given the `main.js` setup, it's outside the project root by default.
